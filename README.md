# Project MySQL One for All

This project was developed while I was studying SQL at Trybe Programming School.

Skills I needed for this project:

- Normalize non-normalized worksheets;
- Create queries to find the requested data;

Regular deadline: May 16, 2023 at 2:00 pm

In the challenges folder, there are files called desafioN.sql, each N equals the number of the challenge I performed.

In the *SpotifyClone-Non-NormalizedTable.xlsx* file, you can see a spreadsheet with the initial tables.

**Note:** The actual Spotify database is much more complete and complex than the one shown below.

After normalization, the database tables were created in the desafio1.sql file.

The desafio1.json configuration file has been adjusted to map which table and column contains the necessary information for Trybe's automated assessment.

MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_PASSWORD=password MYSQL_HOSTNAME=localhost npm test # run all tests
MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_PASSWORD=password MYSQL_HOSTNAME=localhost npm test -- -t "01" # run test 01
